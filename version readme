client->kill server->NoSuchElementException

server->kill client->NullPointerException

check->InetAddress->getLocalHost().getLocalAddress()

write the client thread class

rename clientworker -> serverthread

test->client killed->server thread->readline->null 
client->return->readline->””

upgrade from 15.1->debugged

work on message to subscribers after calling [subscribe] -> basically OKAY 

WORK on server killed->client should detect and write to the local file

when a client send the add command to servers, servers forward the add command to other clients except the original message sender

try to clean up the files and fix the bugs

fixed a bug in the clientserver->listen->while(true)->in.get(i).readline->here i<servers.size -> server.size may change -> should be in.size() 

try to work on remove a server, the request is initiate by a client, all the servers would receive the command, delete the server from [servers]. the to be deleted server will send message to all the connected clients, the clients will close the socket associate with this server and delete this server from [servers]. finally the to be delete server will exit.

rewrite the constructor method of ClientThread, add one argument->svrInfo, which is used to create a socket to connect to the server, this socket is used to listen to the message from the server like update after subscribe cmd, add, delete, restart, here one thread only contains one socket corresponding to the svrInfo. 

move the while loop for user input to the main method of client.java. a major part in this while loop is the code block dealing with the local input add cmd, which includes both the add cmd at the start stage of the client program and the later add cmd during the execution of the client program.

clear up the /**/ and // blocks

create helper methods in SvrThread->doListen, doRestart, doAdd, doDel

try to create backup for the topics->publish->get->tested->passed

work on remove topic and unsubscribe topic -> tested -> passed

try to build the svrData class -> done -> fix the bug of depublish -> backupSvr -> else if -> !nopartnum case

try to build the class for consistent hashing

work on the part relocation - interim version

continue working on part reloc -> add/delete server -> tested

killed->restart-> recover from local files -> data/info -> tested

work on recover from backup server -> update data/info

backup after add/delete

work on backup when add/delete servers->build a separate backup topics
