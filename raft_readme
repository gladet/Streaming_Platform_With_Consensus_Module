抱歉最近较忙没有及时给你回复。因为我没有在教育和游戏公司工作的经历，也不认识在这类公司工作的朋友，所以目前没有办法回答你提出的问题。不过参考一个朋友的job offer中的条款（如下）来看，公司与员工雇佣关系可以随时无条件解除，我想应该不存在对员工过度保护从而对公司造成不利的问题。另外，最近和一个朋友聊天时了解到，在美开办企业的企业所得税税率取决于公司注册所在州，但是他记不清楚具体是哪一州税率较低了。
Employment with the Company is for no specific period of time. Your employment with the Company will be “at will,” meaning that either you or the Company may terminate your employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Any contrary representations which may have been made to you are superseded by this offer. This is the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on this term. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time to time, the “at will” nature of your employment may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.
